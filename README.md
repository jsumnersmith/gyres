**Gyres** [jahy&middot;_uh_rs] is a basic tool to help you make sense of your next iteration milestone from either Basecamp Classic or Github.

## How Gyres Works
A lot of good software development revolves around milestone-driven iterations.
Currently, when using Basecamp this is an extremely abstract proposition.
This is no fault of the tool: it never aimed to explicitly serve the iterative approach.
Gyres is the missing link between Basecamp Classic and the iterative approach.

Gyres is an opinionated tool that requires you to think a certain way.
Therefore, when using Basecamp Classic, it's important to structure your Basecamp projects to work with Gyres.
Importantly, you must create milestones (in the future) with an associated to-do list.
Gyres looks for the next upcoming milestone (including today) and grabs the to-dos associated with it.
Without the appropriate Basecamp hygiene, Gyres will simply come up empty.

For more information about associating to-dos with milestones, see [this help article](https://help.37signals.com/basecamp/questions/223-what-does-it-mean-to-relate-a-to-do-list-to-a-milestone).

## Beta 0.1.0
I'm currently getting Gyres ready for 0.1.0. This version should include the following:
[ ] Accounts
[ ] Complete Angular front-end
[ ] Landing page to guide people through setup.

## Open Source Version
Gyres is 100% open source, so feel free to pull down the project and run it yourself.
1. Check out the project`$ git clone https://github.com/jsumnersmith/gyres.git project-name`
2. Run: <code>$ npm install</code>
3. Start up the app: `$ npm run`(or run your own process).
